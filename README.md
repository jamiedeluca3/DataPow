DataPow
=======

A web admin tool powered by Ruby on Rails and Twitter Bootstrap to manage various DataPower tasks from a centralized site. The calls to the DataPower devices are made via soap requests to the XML management interface. The SOAP constructors were developed to be modular and reusable, so when new features are needed, you spend less time constructing soap messages.

There are various roles mapped and controlled within the tool, for example Developers, Administrators, Operators, Enhanced Developers, etc. The different roles are mapped to certain functions and features within the tool to limit and control access.

Here is a snapshot of the 'hosts' page. Hostnames are blanked out, but the page shows pertinent information related to the device. This is useful to get the status of the device, and inventory of devices.
